# environment_ucb

A Flutter app with Spring Boot as backend that allows professors to reserve a classroom for extra classes. Classroom assignment is automatic, and professors only need to indicate which environment they want to reserve. Additionally, professors can register their entrance by scanning a QR code located in the assigned classroom. If professors have any concerns about the reservation, they can take pictures of the classroom and submit a claim.

Furthermore, an administrator can accept or decline a reservation and also address any claims by providing a response and reviewing the professor's claim.
