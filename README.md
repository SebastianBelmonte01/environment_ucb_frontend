# environment_ucb

A Flutter App that allows proffessors to reserve a classroom for extra classes. Classroom asignation is automatic and proffesors just need to indicate which environment want to reserve. Moreover, proffessors register their entrance scanning a QR that is on the classroom assigned. If the proffesors have any claim of the reservation, they can take pictures of the classroom and make a claim of the reservation. 

Furthermore, an administrator can accept or decline a reservation and also can attend any claim by sendin a response and reviewing the claim of the proffessor.
